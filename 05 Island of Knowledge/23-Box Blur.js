/**
 * Last night you partied a little too hard. Now there's a black and white photo of you that's about to go viral! 
 * You can't let this ruin your reputation, so you want to apply the box blur algorithm to the photo to hide its 
 * content.
 * The pixels in the input image are represented as integers. 
 * The algorithm distorts the input image in the following way: 
 * Every pixel x in the output image has a value equal to the average value of the pixel 
 * values from the 3 Ã— 3 square that has its center at x, including x itself. 
 * All the pixels on the border of x are then removed.
 * Return the blurred image as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.
