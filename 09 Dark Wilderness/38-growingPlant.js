/**
 * Caring for a plant can be hard work, but since you tend to it regularly, you have a plant that grows consistently.
 * Each day, its height increases by a fixed amount represented by the integer upSpeed. 
 * But due to lack of sunlight, the plant decreases in height every night, by an amount represented by downSpeed.
 * Since you grew the plant from a seed, it started at height 0 initially. 
 * Given an integer desiredHeight, your task is to find how many days it'll take for the plant to reach this height.
